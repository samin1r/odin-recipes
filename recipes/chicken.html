    <h2>Roasted Chicken Ingredients</h2>
    <p>路 Chicken: This recipe starts with a 3-pound whole chicken.
    If your bird is larger or smaller, you'll need to adjust the recipe.</p>
    <p>路 Seasonings: This roasted chicken is simply seasoned with salt, black pepper, and 
        onion powder.</p>
    <p>路 Butter: Butter (or margarine, if you prefer) locks in moisture and gives the 
        seasonings something to adhere to.</p>
    <p>路 Celery: Stuff the chicken cavity with celery for subtle vegetal flavor. Plus, 
        the celery will release even more moisture as the chicken cooks.</p>
